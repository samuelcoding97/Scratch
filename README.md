# Scratch Program with conditionals: "Penguin Jim's Apple"
This is my first "coding" project from week 0 of Harvard's CS50 course. The program uses a sprite penguin, Jim. Jim asks a series of questions and has conditional responses based upon the user's input. The program uses movement, sound effects, mouse input and keyboard input.
